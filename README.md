# bitcoinPriceAnalysis
The project revolves around understanding, analyzing and comparing how different machine learning models work while predicting a price value for a cryptocurrency by taking into account the sentiments of public. The data for sentiment was gather through Twitter API and we calculated the sentiments of those tweets using TextBlob Library. Or model compared the price to sentoment and understood whether decrease in price was due to negative sentiment of tweets and vice versa. The models used are C-Support Vector Classification, Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier and K-Neighbor Classifier. The highest accuracy of KNN-classifier which was around 64%.
The Dataset for Bitcoin tweets was taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/kaushiksuresh147/bitcoin-tweets
